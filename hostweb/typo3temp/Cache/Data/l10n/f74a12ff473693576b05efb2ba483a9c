Fields in the editing forms are prioritized so that certain fields of generally lesser interest is moved to a so called "palette".

From the Web>List module you can activate editing of multiple records at a time. This is done when you list a single table and enable multiple columns for display (see Web>List module for details) - then icons will link you to a form with multiple records displayed, possibly with only certain fields available for editing.

<b>Frontend Editing</b>
Another way of editing records in TYPO3 is using the website frontend. Depending on your user credentials you will see small pencil icons in the frontend. When you click these you will be guided to a form where you can also change the content.

You will have to confirm the creation of the shortcut. It is nothing dangerous - only annoying to clean up if you happen to create shortcuts against your own will. Just answer "OK" here.
When you answer "OK" you should immediately see the shortcut frame reload and a new icon (the module icon) appear. If you click this icon you will now jump to the page you created the shortcut from!
You can name shortcuts, you can even group them and share them. If you want to edit or delete a shortcut you select the "Edit" checkbox and then click the shortcut icon. This will reload the shortcut frame so you get a field for entering a title. You can also delete all shortcuts in a "group" - here, just click the "0" (zero) to the left of the icons and you will remove all shortcuts in the group.";}}s:18:"bookmarks.alttitle";a:1:{i:0;a:2:{s:6:"source";s:17:"Backend Bookmarks";s:6:"target";s:17:"Backend Bookmarks";}}s:21:"bookmarks.description";a:1:{i:0;a:2:{s:6:"source";s:290:"You can create bookmarks to modules in TYPO3 quite easily.
