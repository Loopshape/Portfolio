What does it do?
================

The extension offers two new actions for extensions within the extension manager list view.

If any file in an extension was changed you will get a visible notification. On an one-click event a list with modified, new and removed files is shown.

For each modified extension an additional action is displayed which provides the rewrite of  the ext_emconf.php file.
