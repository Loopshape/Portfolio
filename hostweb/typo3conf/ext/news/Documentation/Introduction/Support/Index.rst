Need Support?
=============
There are various ways to get support for EXT:news!

Mailing-list
------------
If you need help with the news extension, you can always ask in the
public mailinglist *typo3.projects.news*.

.. tip::

   If you got any extbase / fluid related questions which don't deal with
   EXT:news directly, it is maybe better to use the mailing-list *typo3.projects.typo3v4mvc*.

Slack
-----
A dedicated channel on slack can be be used to get in touch with other users!

The url is: https://typo3.slack.com/messages/ext-news/

.. note::

   If you are not yet registered, use http://forger.typo3.org/slack for that!
