.. _settings-dateField:

dateField
"""""""""

:typoscript:`plugin.tx_news.settings.dateField =1`

excludeAlreadyDisplayedNews
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If checked, news items which are already rendered are excluded in the current plugin. To exclude news items, the viewHelper <n:excludeDisplayedNews newsItem="{newsItem}" /> needs to be added to the template.
