.. _what:

What does it do?
----------------

Powermail is a powerful and – in addition – a very easy mailform
extension with a wide range of tools and features for editors, admins
and developers. Define your form in the backend with a few clicks and
look at the final output in the frontend.

Some basic points:

- Main features of this mailform extension is to store the mails into
  the database. Export it from the backend module (xls, csv) or list the
  values in the frontend again (Pi2).

- Powermail send one or more mails to a static receiver or to dynamic receivers or
  to a whole Frontent-User Group.

- Different HTML-Templates (Fluid) and RTE fields in backend for all
  needed views.

- Input Validation in different ways (HTML5, JavaScript and PHP).

- A main focus of the form is to prevent spam (Captcha, Spam Factor,
  Different Checks, etc...).

- Another focus is to track some interesting information of users
  (funnel, browser, language, country, etc...)

- For Developers: Powermail is a very flexible extension, which also
  could be extended by your code or extension (hooks, signalslots,
  TypoScript cObjects and userFuncs, debugoutput, etc...).

Cut a long story short: With powermail editors are able to create complex
mailforms without knowledge of html, php or javascript and that's the main difference
between powermail and the most other form extensions


.. _whats-new:

What's new in powermail 2.1 or 2.2?
-----------------------------------

Powermail 2.1 uses the same data-structure that was created with powermail 2.0 (see below).
But there was another code-refactoring especially for TYPO3 6.2 LTS and upcoming versions.

- Quality
  - Added Behavior-Tests for many Frontend-Functions (With Behat with Mink and Selenium)
  - Unittests added for different methods (e.g. all serverside validators)
  - A Testparcour was generated to test the main features of powermail (**UP**)
  - We focussed on TYPO3 6.2 LTS to increase quality

**UP** = Part of the University Package (see sponsors note)

What's new in powermail 2.0?
----------------------------

Powermail >= 2.0 is a complete rebuild of the old powermail. Main
focus was to keep flexibility and all the features and to create even
more. The rebuild was done with Extbase and Fluid.
