from removeComments (useful for indexed\_search),

Bugfix:conflicts with some combination of options

(by Ronald Steiner)

**0.3.1**

Bugfix: Some options didn't have any effect although enabled

**0.3**

Bugfix: The option trim\_lines now also removes tabs. The option
remove\_tabs has been removed.

Change: The option keep\_typo3\_copyright has been removed (see next
point)

Change: Removed three options: remove\_script\_cdata,
move\_inline\_css, move\_inline\_css\_file, as these options are now
in the core-engine included and remove\_script\_cdata removed the JS
for spamProtection too (thanks to Brikou and Christian Meyer)

Change: To remove comments you have now three options: don't remove
them, remove them only from the body or everywhere (thanks to Bernd
Hanisch)

Bugfix: The option remove\_new\_lines now also removes space between
tags that don't contain any string

New: Remove breaks, empty lines and trim lines: you can limit it to
the body or still do it everywhere (thanks to Bernd Hanisch)

Hanisch)
