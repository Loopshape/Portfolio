What does it do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Calendarize is a flexible calendar for TYPO3. The aim of the extension is NOT the base structure of events (location, category etc.). The aim of the extension is the timely representation of ExtBase models (any kind) in a index.
Futher more the extension is shipped with different calendar views.
