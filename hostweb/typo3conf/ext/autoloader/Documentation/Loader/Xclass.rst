Xclass
^^^^^^

All Xclasses (Attention: This is the new TYPO3_CONF_VARS/SYS/Objects mechanism and not the old Xclass mechanism) in the folder "Classes/Xclass" will be registered. The classes are reflected and registered to the TYPO3 core. Just create a own class, extend an existing class and the loader will do the magic!
