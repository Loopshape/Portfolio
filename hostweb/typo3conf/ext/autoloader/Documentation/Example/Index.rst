Examples
--------

We deliver some small :index:`examples` with the autoloader-extension.


Where to find?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You find the examples in the autoloader-extension in the folder ``Resources\Private\Examples\``.

How to use them?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the examples we provide a shell-script to fast linking them into the ext-folder. Simple go to the ``Resources/Private/Shell/`` folder and execute the ``LinkExampleExtension.sh``.

.. note::

   Probably you have to make the script executable.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd Resources/private/Shell/
   ./LinkExampleExtension.sh

In the TYPO3-Backend you find now the example-Extensions ready to install.
