This extension implements a css highlighting for requested search words, url calls via google referrer or other url params on the destination page.
The extension bases on code from psm_highlight and was rebuilt for TYPO3 6.2 compatibility.


.. _team: http://forge.typo3.org/projects/typo3v4-official_extension_template/issues

For instance you use indexed_search and search for the word "example".
Now you can add the search word to the typolink for url generation in indexed_search result list.
In requested page you see the search word highlighted.
