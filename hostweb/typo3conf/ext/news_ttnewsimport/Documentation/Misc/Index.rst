Known issues
------------

* I get errors when trying to run the importer
	Make sure the ext:news extbase models are generated. This can easily be done by opening a FE page with the ext:news plugin on it.
* After import the images are media items and not FAL references.
	Make sure you have enabled FAL support in the extension manager configuration of ext:news


Further development
-------------------

The git repository of `ext:news_ttnewsimport <https://github.com/fsaris/news_ttnewsimport>`_ can be found on Github.

Pull request and suggestions for improvement are very welcome.
