<h3>PHP • PayPal REST API - Small How to</h3>
<p>
    <strong> -------------------------------------------------------
    <br />
    If you want to use ExpressCheckout via the REST API from Paypal, you can follow these steps to get a working API within your webapp.
    <br />
    <br />
    1. Install Composer, Curl and PHP on a Webserver
    <br />
    <br />
    2. a) Create a composer.json file with following data from the top of this page:
    <br />
    <span class="bold">https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/api/</span>
    <br />
    <br />
    2.b) Install the libraries with composer install
    <br />
    <br />
    2.c) Include the autoload.php from the Composer installation with a require_once.
    <br />
    <br />
    3.a) Setup the REST-API-SDK-PHP library files with your credentials from the Paypal developer site:
    <br />
    <span class="bold">sdk_config.ini</span> and in the bootstrap.php that could be found in the folder <span class="bold">vendor/paypal/rest-api-sdk-php</span>
    <br />
    <br />
    3.b) Set up a define command with a pointer to the sdk_config.ini file.
    <br />
    <span class="bold">define('PP_CONFIG_PATH', ...path to the sdk_config.ini file...);</span>
    <br />
    <br />
    4. Build a form with a PayPal-button and send the form parameters via $_POST to this file:
    <br />
    <span class="bold">https://github.com/paypal/rest-api-sdk-php/blob/master/sample/payments/CreatePaymentUsingPayPal.php</span>
    <br />
    <br />
    5. After successful payment from the Paypal website you have to redirect the user to this file:
    <br />
    <span class="bold">https://github.com/paypal/rest-api-sdk-php/blob/master/sample/payments/ExecutePayment.php</span>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    You are done. Hope this short HowTo was helpful.
