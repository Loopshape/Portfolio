Intention
---------

If you like this extension. Or any other of my extension, you are
invited to contribute to my idea of a beautiful world. You could spend
money to any non-profit environmental or humanitarian organization
like Greenpeace, WWF, Global 2000, Amnesty International, Care, etc.

.. tip:: In Austria you can get a tax exempt for donations to some organizations
   recognized by the government. Maybe this is also applies to your home country.

Or if you don't want to spend any money, I think it would at least not be
a bad idea if you take some time during this day, and at least bid,
pray (or whatever else your religion/belief suggests) for more peace,
freedom and a better future.
