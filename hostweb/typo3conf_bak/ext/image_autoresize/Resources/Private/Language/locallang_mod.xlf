				<source>This task crawls directories, searches for files that were not resized automatically during upload (e.g., because they were uploaded through a direct mechanism such as FTP) and resizes them according to your rules. Please note that rules based on user groups will match but then skipped as in the context of the schedular task, groups do not exist.</source>
