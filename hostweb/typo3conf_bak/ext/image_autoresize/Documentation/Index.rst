	:Classification:
		image_autoresize

	:Version:
		|release|

	:Language:
		en

	:Description:
		Simplify the way your editors may upload their images: no complex local procedure needed, let TYPO3
		automatically resize down their huge images/pictures on-the-fly during upload (or using a scheduler task for
		batch processing) and according to your own business rules (directory/groups). This will highly reduce the
		footprint on your server and speed-up response time if lots of images are rendered (e.g., in a gallery).
		Features an EXIF/IPTC extractor to ensure metadata may be used by the FAL indexer even if not preserved upon
		resizing.
