* Thanks to swm medienproduktion for sponsoring this version.
* Note: This version updates the database!
* task: Extend hook 'modifyFileIndexEntry' in file indexer. Note: Needs adjustment in your code if you use that hook!

* bugfix: fix "Illegal string offset 'langChildren'" error in backend when inserting pi3 (textlinks multiselection).
* task: show path in backend module in mode "show indexed content".
* bugfix: files indexed by the standalone file indexer can't be tagged. Thanks to Felix Jacobi, https://forge.typo3.org/issues/59543.

* bugfix: use mb_strtolower to convert strings saved to the statistic table. This words are also used for the autocomplete function with ke_search_premium.

* bugfix: fix PHP warning in scheduler for file indexer in TYPO3 >= 6.2.
