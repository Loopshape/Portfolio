<p>
	Search for duplicate records by storage based on their identifier.
</p>

<v:button.toolWork tool="TYPO3\CMS\Media\Tool\DuplicateRecordsFinderTool" label="Find duplicate records"/>

<p>The same can be performed by a CLI command:</p>
<pre style="font-size: 9pt">
cd {sitePath};
./typo3/cli_dispatch.phpsh extbase duplicateRecords:analyse
</pre>

Tip! You can also configure a <strong>Scheduler Task which will send a report by email to <m:reportTo /></strong> if anything looks wrong.
