ToDo
----

- Update the documentation to the new Extension Structure (6.2/7.0 and CachingFramework changes)
- Implement crawler extension just like Kaspers staticpub extension has. The big question here is how to support crawling multiple domains. If you have any suggestions, please contact me.
- Implement backend 'context menu' item to 'cache this branch now'.
- If a page links to another page internally and the title of the 'target page' changes . . . then the static file of the 'target page' is cleared. What happens to the page containing the link? Does TYPO3 clear the cache for this page too? Does it use references to track this? If so, all is fine. This needs to be checked.
- Currently we have no TODO. If you have great innovative ideas, please let us know by posting a feauture request: http://forge.typo3.org/projects/extension-nc_staticfilecache/issues
