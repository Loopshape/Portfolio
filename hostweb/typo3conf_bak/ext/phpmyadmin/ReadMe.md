# phpMyAdmin Database Management Utility

phpMyAdmin is a free software tool written in PHP, intended to handle the administration of MySQL over 
the Web. phpMyAdmin supports a wide range of operations on MySQL, MariaDB and Drizzle. Frequently 
used operations (managing databases, tables, columns, relations, indexes, users, permissions, etc) 
can be performed via the user interface, while you still have the ability to directly 
execute any SQL statement - see http://www.phpmyadmin.net/

## Requirements and known issues
* The included phpMyAdmin 4.0.x is an older version and compatible with PHP 5.2 and MySQL 5. 
  It is supported for security fixes only (until Jan 1, 2016). Compatibility of TYPO3 extension
  is set to TYPO3 4.5-LTS to 6.2-LTS - but it may NOT WORK due to an »incompatible« PHP version.
  
## Roadmap
With the end of support for phpMyAdmin 4.0 it will be replaced by 4.4 and the TYPO3 version constraint 
will be at least 6.2-LTS. This change is expected to happen until the end of 2015.
