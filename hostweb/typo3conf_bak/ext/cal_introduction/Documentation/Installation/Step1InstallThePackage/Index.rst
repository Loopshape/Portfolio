Step 1: Install the Package
==============================

.. include:: ../../Includes.txt

The Calendar Base introduction package can be installed through the typical TYPO3 installation process using the Extension Manager.

During the installation process may take a while. Behind the scene the package will install: bootstrap_package, realurl and cal. Due to some class loading restrictions the wec_map extension has to be installed through ":ref:`Step2InstallWecMap`".
Additionally to the plugins a page tree will be imported.
